# DeixUtils
## Features
### Discord - Minecraft Chat Linking
Works with my DeixBot discord bot to mirror Minecraft chat and events into a Discord channel and vice versa
- Player Chat
- Player Join/Leave
- Player Death
### Player Only Pressure Plates
Wooden Pressure Plates can only be triggered by a player - Animal, Mob and Villager Proof automatic doors!
### Nether Portal Calculator
/nethercoords command - calculate the exact coordinates to build a portal in the opposite dimension to perfectly link with a portal at your current coordinates
### Say Coordinates
/saycoords command - send your current X/Y/Z coords to others in chat. Will also be sent to the linked Discord channel
### Custom Recipies
Adds shapeless recipies to recolour wool - 8 wool and a piece of dye will yield 8 recoloured wool
### Skip Nights Without Everyone In Bed
At night, only 25% (by default) of players in the overworld need to be in bed to skip to morning
### Config updates 
- /togglediscord command to enable/disable all Discord integrations
- /config command - update plugin configs on the fly. Includes tab completion!
